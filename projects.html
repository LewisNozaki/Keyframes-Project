        <p>Project: PacMen Exercise</p>
        <div class="project pacman" onmouseover="givePacmanInfo()" onmouseout="hidePacmanInfo()">
            <div class="pacman-info"><b><u>PacMen Exercise</u></b>
                <br></br>In this project I created an interactive game which the main objective is to eat as many pellets as you can while Pacman moves in a random path within the game screen. <br></br>
                 This project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the focus on recursions, setTimeouts and click events.

        <p>Project: Eye Exercise</p>
        <div class="project eyes" onmouseover="giveEyesInfo()" onmouseout="hideEyesInfo()">
            <div class="eyes-info"><b><u>Eye Exercise</u></b>
                <br></br>In this project I created an interactive creature with eyes that follow the mouse's movements. When mouse is over the eye(s), it will turn pink and close and result in a frown. It will return back to normal 2.5secs after the mouse has moved off the affected eye(s).  <br></br>
                This project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the focus on SVG manipulation, setTimeouts and mouse events.

        <p>Project: Real Time Bus Tracker</p>
        <div class="project bus" onmouseover="giveBusInfo()" onmouseout="hideBusInfo()">
            <div class="bus-info"><b><u>Real Time Bus Tracker</u></b>
                <br></br>In this project I created an interactive map of Honolulu, Hawaii. There are buttons that show a bus route from the mall to the state capital and another to move the bus marker along the route.  <br></br>
                This project was created using mapbox, HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the focus on external APIs, SVG manipulation, setTimeouts and mouse events.
